This script uses the GitHub REST API to remove every issue label from a given
repository and then creates new one from a file.

The first argument of the script must be the name of the repository.

Required files in this directory:

* `user`
  Plaintext file that contains the name of the GitHub user

* `access_token`
  GitHub Personal access token for the user.
  The token requires the `repo/public_repo` scope

* `github_issue_labels.json`
  A JSON file that contains an array of GitHub labels.
  These labels will replace the old issue labels of the repository.
  The schema of these labels must be: { "name": string, "description": string, "color": string }
